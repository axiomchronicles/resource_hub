## About

College Resource Finder is a UI-first front-end template/application that helps students discover, preview, and manage academic resources (Notes, PPTs, Past Papers, Tutorials). It focuses on delightful animations, accessible interactions, and production-level developer ergonomics.

Built to be: **component-driven**, **performant**, and **easy to extend**.

## Key Features

* Multi-page SPA with smooth route transitions.

**5. Tutorials (`/tutorials`)**

* Mixed content feed: videos, PDFs, external links.
* YouTube modals with zoom + fade animation.
* Tag filtering (Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced).

**6. Upload (`/upload`)**

* Drag-and-drop zone with file thumbnail previews.
* Animated progress bars and success checkmark.
* Auto-tag suggestion based on filename heuristics.

**7. Resource Details (`/resource/:id`)**

* Tabbed preview area (Preview / Details / Comments) with tab-switch animation.
* Download counter with animated increment.
* Real-time comments feed (UI shows appearing messages).

**8. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)**

* Count-up stat cards (uploads, downloads, active users).
* Editable table of uploaded files with inline editing interactions.
* Upload history timeline with animated reveal.

**9. My Library (`/library`)**

* Grid/list of saved resources.
* Filter & sort options (date added, type, popularity).

## Animation & Micro-Interaction Layer

* **Page transitions:** route-based slide + fade using Framer Motion.
* **Hover effects:** depth shadows, color transitions, animated icons.
* **Content reveal:** staggered list reveals for better perceived performance.
* **Skeleton loaders:** shimmer placeholders while fetching data.
* **Theme toggle:** dark/light with smooth cross-fade.
* **Button presses:** optional ripple for tactile feedback.
* **Lottie:** small vector animations for success states or empty screens.

Implementation tip: centralize transition presets (duration, easing, stagger) in a `motionPresets.ts` to keep motion consistent across components.

## Visual & Design Language

* **Typography:** Inter / SF Pro / Plus Jakarta Sans (system fallback recommended).
* **Colors:** soft greys with a gradient accent (blue → purple).
* **Glassmorphism:** translucent modals and panels for premium look.
* **Corner style:** `rounded-2xl` for cards and dialogs.
* **Icons:** `lucide-react` or `phosphor-react` with animated micro-interactions.

Keep a `design-tokens` folder with JSON/Tokens for colors, radii, spacing to keep the design system consistent.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React + Vite
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (with JIT)
* **Animations:** Framer Motion, Lottie
* **UI primitives:** Radix UI, shadcn/ui
* **Routing:** React Router DOM
* **State:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit (choose based on app complexity)
* **Forms / Uploads:** react-hook-form, use-immer for immutable updates
* **Bundling / Code-splitting:** Vite lazy imports
* **PWA:** Workbox or Vite PWA plugin
* **Testing:** Jest + React Testing Library, Playwright / Cypress for E2E
* **Lint & Formatting:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript (recommended)

## Getting Started (Developer)

> Prerequisites: Node >= 18, pnpm/npm/yarn

```bash
# clone
git clone <repo-url>
cd college-resource-ui

# install
pnpm install

# dev server
pnpm dev

# build
pnpm build

# preview production build
pnpm preview
```

Add these helpful scripts to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "lint": "eslint './src/**/*.{ts,tsx}' --fix",
    "test": "vitest",
    "storybook": "start-storybook -p 6006",
    "format": "prettier --write ."
  }
}
```

## Project Structure (suggested)

```

├─ services/     # api clients, caching adapters
├─ styles/       # tailwind overrides & design tokens
└─ utils/
```

## Design Tokens & Tailwind Configuration

* Create a `tokens.json` (colors, spacing, radii) and import into `tailwind.config.js`.
* Use CSS variables for theme switching (light/dark) and animate between them.

Example tokens:

```json
{
  "color": {
    "bg": "--bg",
    "accent": "--accent-gradient"
  }
}
```

## State Management & Data Flow

* **Search & Filters:** Keep UI state local to pages, but sync important selections (e.g., library) to global state.
* **Cache & Offline:** use an abstraction (`services/cache`) backed by IndexedDB (localforage) for previewed files and search cache.
* **Optimistic UI:** for bookmark / save actions to feel instant.

## Accessibility

* Keyboard-focusable interactive elements, visible focus rings.
* Proper ARIA roles for lists, dialogs, and live regions (e.g., search announcements).
* High-contrast mode toggle and semantic HTML.
* Ensure all motion can be reduced using `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Testing & Quality

* Unit tests for core components with Jest / Vitest and react-testing-library.
* Visual regression tests for key screens (Storybook + Chromatic or Percy).
* End-to-end flows for upload, preview, and bulk download (Playwright/Cypress).

## Performance & PWA

* Lazy load heavy components (PDF viewer, video player).
* Use `react-window` or similar for long lists (notes infinite scroll).
* Optimize thumbnails and use `srcset` for images.
* PWA: cache critical routes and recently viewed resources for offline access.

## Deployment

* Serve the built assets on any static host (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages).
* If backend APIs required for search / uploads — deploy API separately (e.g., Serverless / Fly / Render) and set appropriate CORS and service worker strategies.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
2. Follow the component conventions (presentational vs container).
3. Add tests for new features.
4. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.

## Roadmap & Extra Ideas

* AI-powered auto-tagging & recommended resources.
* Social features: comments with upvotes, resource rating.
* Integrate institutional SSO (Google Workspace / Microsoft).
* Admin portal for moderation & analytics.

If you want, I can also generate:

* A `tailwind.config.js` starter tuned to the palette & motion presets.
* A `Vite` + React + TypeScript starter with recommended dependencies and example components (Search bar, Preview Drawer, Animated Card).
* Storybook stories for all major components.
